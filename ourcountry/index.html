<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Hunting
with HCH today takes place on private land. All of our country is away
from the kennel and some of it is very distant. Rural Sprawl is the culprit,
that even more pernicious evil twin of the urban kind. Nevertheless, we
are very lucky and resourceful to have this land for our sport-and very
obliged to the landowner. For this reason, if for no other, we must show
the landowner and his property every respect.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>Many
think that our hunt country is difficult. By that they mean hard to hunt
and somewhat rough. Much of the country is wooded, or in covert, where
the game like to hide and in which it is hard to see hounds. The terrain
is mostly high, wide, open ridges cut with wooded draws. Many places are
steep and rocky, but on the whole, the footing is good and safe. Horses
take it well.&nbsp;</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>The
hunt country is beautiful, and some of the last open places most of us
have the chance to visit. While foxhunting is not a nature ramble, enjoying
nature is a happy part of the experience, and no foxhunter is immune to
color in the fall or the purple haze of a wood in winter, despite protests
to the contrary. As one anonymous Yorkshire farmer commented, when confronted
by a visitor to the moors going on about the view, "I know nowt about beauty,
but I'm a bugger for scenery".&nbsp;</font></font></font> &nbsp;<center><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=-1>&nbsp;</font></font></font>&nbsp;</center>
